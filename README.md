# mmVital - Radar-based vital signs monitoring system
The project aims to design and develop a suite of novel AI, Machine learning and signal processing techniques for non-contact vital signs monitoring based on mmWave radar sensors. The system can be used to continuously measure heart and respiratory rates (HR/RR) of semi-stationary targets with various body positions and postures under controlled environments <br><br>
The project includes: <br>
<ul>
<li> TI's mmWave radar configurations </li>
<li> Vital signs (HR/RR) estimation </li>
<li> Vibration simulation platform </li>
<li> Published results and work-in-progress </li>
</ul>
